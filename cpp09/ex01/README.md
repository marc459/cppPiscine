## RPN

RPN is a program that does reverse polish notation.

What this means?

    In reverse Polish notation, the operators follow their operands. For example, to add 3 and 4 together, the expression is 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4. The expression 3 − 4 + 5 in conventional notation is 3 4 − 5 + in reverse Polish notation: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it.

In this case we use the stack container because we need a "First In Last Out"(FILO) data structure.
